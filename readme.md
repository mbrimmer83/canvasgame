This is the initial version of the canvas game project done in week three of my DigitalCrafts class.
The game uses a canvas layout to render the images and control them.  The game introduced me to the canvas in html 5 and
showed me another method for rendering and controlling items outside the DOM.
  - Introduced to HTML5 canvas
  - Learned methods for handling keyboard events and different methods to decouple keystrokes from keyboard
  - Expanded native DOM techniques(no much jquery used)
  - Learned how to use function to build continuous loops and how to time events within the script
    - setTimeout methods
